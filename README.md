# WindBorne Embedded Electrical Engineer – Application

## Context
I am applying for the Embedded Electrical Engineer role at WindBorne Systems.

While I have not yet owned the full PCB layout-to-fabrication cycle, I have strong experience in:
- embedded firmware development
- board bring-up on custom and evaluation hardware
- reading schematics and datasheets
- debugging real hardware issues using lab equipment
- system-level tradeoffs between firmware and hardware

I wanted to submit transparently and show how I approach hardware problems.

## Hardware Debug & Bring-Up Experience

### Example: Embedded System Bring-Up
- MCU firmware bring-up (clocking, boot, peripheral init)
- Debugging SPI / I2C / UART communication issues
- Power sequencing and brown-out troubleshooting
- Identifying signal integrity and timing issues using scope / logic analyzer

### Design Reasoning (without PCB ownership)
When working with existing boards, I focus on:
- understanding decoupling and power integrity from schematics
- validating assumptions made in the hardware design
- finding firmware-side mitigations for marginal hardware
- documenting failure modes and test procedures

## What I Would Build First at WindBorne
If brought on, my first priorities would be:
- rapid familiarity with existing schematics and layouts
- aggressive bring-up documentation
- building internal test firmware to surface edge cases early
- working closely with mechanical and manufacturing teams to shorten iteration cycles

## Closing
I understand PCB ownership is a core part of this role.
If my background is still of interest, I would be excited to ramp quickly into full PCB design responsibility.
